client/src/App.js issues:
GET /todos on mount
POST /todos to add
PUT /todos/:id to toggle
DELETE /todos/:id to remove

Why: 1. Demonstrates the classic CRUD flow over HTTP.
     2. Let me confirm the data contract between front-end and back-end.

Advantages: 1. Decoupled API—any client (mobile, another web app) could talk to it.
            2. Easy to test with curl or Postman.

Disadvantages: 1. No error handling or retry logic in our simple example.
               2. In real apps, you’d type your responses (TypeScript) or validate inputs server-side.

Things to keep in mind: 1. Add proper error messages and UI feedback.
                        2. Implement authorization/authentication.
                        3. Move to a typed interface (e.g. JSON schema or TypeScript).
